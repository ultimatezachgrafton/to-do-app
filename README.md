To-Do App utilizing javascript and local storage.

Got stuff to do? Type an item and hit enter to add it to your list.
Click an item to cross it out and feel the endorphins flow (this is the BEST and most ESSENTIAL function of any to-do app).
Click it again to delete it right out of there.

Summary
I wrote this app to learn to communicate with local storage. 
My intention was to keep the styling minimal. Who wants visual clutter stressing them out when they update their to-do list?
