1. Type an item and hit enter to add it to your list.
2. Click an item to cross it out and feel the endorphins flow (this is the BEST and most ESSENTIAL function of any to-do app).
3. Click it again to delete it right out of there.

<b>Summary</b><br>
I wrote this app to learn to communicate with local storage and to dynamically update the page to reflect user-based changes in real time. Stylistically, my intention was to keep everything minimally cluttered. All was completed without any libraries.
